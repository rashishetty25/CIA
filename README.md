### ***Benchmarking Efficiency of Programming Languages***
Course Code: ITS0704
Course:Computing for Data Sciences using R, Python and Java

The objective was to compare the efficiency of various programming languages using code execution times for a
singular task. Jupyter Notebook was chosen as the optimal interface for code execution and profiling. The results
obtained through benchmarking and profiling are instrumental in enabling informed decisions when selecting a
language to optimize performance for similar computational tasks.

Languages used: Python, Cython and Julia

Methodology:
1. Python
2. Python using loops
3. Python using NumPy
4. Cython
5. Julia
